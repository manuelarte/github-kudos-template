# GitHub-Kudos Template
Template to use github-kudos. Use this repository as a template to write your kudos to other github users.

## Getting Started

### Repository Name

The GitHub-Kudos app is looking for a repository called **gitub-kudos**, so make sure that your repo is called like that.

### Write Kudos

To write kudos to someone you need to create a markdown file with their github username. 
So, for example, you want to give kudos to the user *@manuelarte*, you would need to create a file called **manuelarte.md**, and put your kudos message inside that file.

### Get the image

Once you wrote down your kudos message, you can view the image generated from it at `https://github-kudos.com/{{your-github-username}}/kudos/{{other-github-username}}`.

## Examples

### Already Existing Kudos

Here it is an example on how an already existing kudos image looks like:

![kudos](https://github-kudos.com/manuelarte/kudos/octocat?alpha=255)

### Alice and Bob

So imagine that Alice (username *alice*) wants to give kudos to Bob (username *bob*). What Alice needs to do is:

+ Use this template to create a new repository called **github-kudos**.
+ Create a file named **bob.md**, and write a message.
+ Now, her kudos image is available at **https://github-kudos.com/alice/kudos/bob**
