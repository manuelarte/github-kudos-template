# ðŸ™Œ GitHub-Kudos Template
Template to use github-kudos. Use this repository as a **template** to write your kudos to other github users.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Repository Name

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> GitHub-Kudos is looking for a repository called **github-kudos**.

So make sure that your repo is called like that.

### Write Kudos

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To write kudos to someone, create a **markdown file with their GitHub username**.

So, for example, you want to give kudos to the user *@manuelarte*, you would need to create a file called **manuelarte.md**, and put your kudos message inside that file.

### Get the image

> [!TIP]  
> You can view the image generated from your kudos at `https://github-kudos.com/{{your-github-username}}/kudos/{{other-github-username}}`.

## Examples

### Already Existing Kudos

Here it is an example on how an already existing kudos image looks like:

![kudos](https://github-kudos.com/manuelarte/kudos/octocat?alpha=255)

### Manuelarte and Octocat

So imagine that Manuelarte (username [*manuelarte*](https://github.com/manuelarte)) wants to give kudos to Octocat (username [*octocat*](https://github.com/octocat)). What Manuelarte needs to do is:

+ Use this template to create a new repository called [**manuelarte/github-kudos**](https://github.com/manuelarte/github-kudos).
+ Create a file named [**octocat.md**](https://github.com/manuelarte/github-kudos/octocat.md), and write a message.
+ Now, her kudos image is available at [**https://github-kudos.com/manuelarte/kudos/octocat**](https://github-kudos.com/manuelarte/kudos/octocat)
